    Completed :class:`~qiskit_nature.results.protein_folding_result.ProteinFoldingResult` .
    The result of :class:`~qiskit_nature.problems.sampling.protein_folding.protein_folding_problem.ProteinFoldingProblem`
    is interpreted by this class and translates it into relevant information such as the turns defining the main and side chains
    of the protein, the positions of each aminoacid, as well as a plot of the molecular structure. It does so by using 3 new classes.
    Added :class:`~qiskit_nature.results.protein_folding_result.protein_folding_tools.protein_shape_decoder.ProteinShapeDecoder`. This class takes a raw bitstring result
    and decodes it to yield the turns defining the shape of the molecule.
    Added :class:`~qiskit_nature.results.protein_folding_result.protein_folding_tools.protein_shape_generator.ProteinShapeFileGen`. This class converts the shape of the molecule
    into Cartesian coordinates for each aminoacid in the chain.
    Added :class:`~qiskit_nature.results.protein_folding_result.protein_folding_tools.protein_plotter.ProteinPlotter`. This class creates a plot of the molecule.
