    Completed :class:`~qiskit_nature.results.protein_folding_result.ProteinFoldingResult` .
    The result of :class:`~qiskit_nature.problems.sampling.protein_folding.protein_folding_problem.ProteinFoldingProblem`
    is interpreted by this class and translates it into relevant information such as the turns defining the main and side chains
    of the protein, the positions of each aminoacid, as well as a plot of the molecular structure. It does so by using 3 new classes.

    Added :meth:`~qiskit_nature.results.protein_folding_result.ProteinFoldingResult.save_xyz_file()`. This method saves a .xyz file with
    the cartesian coordinates of the shape of the molecule. The user can also call
    :meth:`~qiskit_nature.results.protein_folding_result.ProteinFoldingResult.protein_shape_file_gen.get_xyz_file()` in order to get an array
    with the data contained in the .xyz file without generating such a file.

    Added :meth:`~qiskit_nature.results.protein_folding_result.ProteinFoldingResult.plot_folded_protein()` which generates a figure of the shape
    of the protein.

    Added :meth:`~qiskit_nature.results.protein_folding_result.ProteinFoldingResult.protein_shape_decoder.main_turns`
    and :meth:`~qiskit_nature.results.protein_folding_result.ProteinFoldingResult.protein_shape_decoder.side_turns` which return the sequences
    of turns for the main chain and side chains respectively.
