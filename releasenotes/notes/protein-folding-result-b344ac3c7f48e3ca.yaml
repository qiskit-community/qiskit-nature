    Added: :class:`~qiskit_nature.results.ProteinFoldingResult`.
    This class handles the result found by running a VQE in
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.problems.sampling.protein_folding.ProteinFoldingProblem`.
    This class has:

    * Method :meth:`~qiskit_nature.results.ProteinFoldingResult.get_figure` which
      generates a figure of the shape of the protein.

    * Method :meth:`~qiskit_nature.results.ProteinFoldingResult.save_xyz_file` which
      saves a .xyz file with the cartesian coordinates of the shape of the molecule.

    * Property :attr:`~qiskit_nature.results.ProteinFoldingResult.protein_shape_file_gen`
      which is an instance of :class:`~qiskit_nature.results.utils.ProteinShapeFileGen`.
      This class has in its turn a method
      :meth:`~qiskit_nature.results.utils.ProteinShapeFileGen.get_xyz_file` which returns
      an array with the data contained in the .xyz file without having to generate such a file.

    * Property :attr:`~qiskit_nature.results.ProteinFoldingResult.protein_shape_decoder`
      which is an instance of :class:`~qiskit_nature.results.utils.ProteinShapeDecoder`.
      This class has in its turn two properties :attr:`~qiskit_nature.results.utils.ProteinShapeDecoder.main_turns`
      and :attr:`~qiskit_nature.results.utils.ProteinShapeDecoder.side_turns` that return
      the turn sequences of the main chain and the side chains respectively.


    .. code-block:: python

        result = protein_folding_problem.interpret(raw_result)
        # Save xyz file in current directory.
        result.save_xyz_file()
        # Generate plot.
        figure = result.get_figure()
