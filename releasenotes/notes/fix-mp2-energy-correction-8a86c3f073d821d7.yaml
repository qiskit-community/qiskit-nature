    Following the MP2 T2 and energy correction calculation fix, the APIs for 
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.algorithms.initial_points.MP2InitialPoint` and
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.algorithms.initial_points.HFInitialPoint` have been changed
    slightly. After setting the `grouped_property`, the `total_energy` and `energy_correction` are
    now accessed via their respective properties, rather than via `get_energy` and 
    `get_energy_correction`.

    Fixed the MP2 T2 amplitudes and energy correction computation to ensure it matches the result
    from PySCF.
