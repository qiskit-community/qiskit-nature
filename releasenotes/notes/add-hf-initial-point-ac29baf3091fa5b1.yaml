    Adds Hartree-Fock (HF) and vibrational self-consistent field (VSCF) initial point classes.
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.algorithms.initial_points.hf_initial_point.HFInitialPoint` and
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.algorithms.initial_points.vscf_initial_point.VSCFInitialPoint`, are to be
    used with :class:`~qiskit_nature.circuit.library.UCC`, and
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.circuit.library.UVCC`, respectively.

    This follows the introduction of
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.algorithms.initial_points.mp2_initial_point.MP2InitialPoint` for
    computing the initial point using the Møller-Plesset 2nd Order (MP2) corrections.

    :class:`~qiskit_nature.algorithms.initial_points.mp2_initial_point.MP2InitialPoint`,
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.algorithms.initial_points.hf_initial_point.HFInitialPoint`, and
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.algorithms.initial_points.vscf_initial_point.VSCFInitialPoint` all
    inherit from the abstract base class
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.algorithms.initial_points.InitialPoint`.

    These initial points are intended to be used as starting VQE parameters when using a UCC ansatz
    (cluster operator coefficients). This should introduce an initial point that is closer to the
    ground state point, leading to fewer overall evaluations for VQE.

    Instances of the appropriate classes are now the default :attr:`initial_point` arguments in
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.algorithms.ground_state_solvers.minimum_eigensolver_factory.vqe_ucc_factory.VQEUCCFactory`
    and
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.algorithms.ground_state_solvers.minimum_eigensolver_factory.vqe_uvcc_factory.VQEUVCCFactory`.

    They can also be used by following the snippets below and passing the result via
    ``initial_point`` to the VQE.

    UCC with HF initial point:

    .. code-block:: python

      hf_initial_point = HFInitialPoint()
      hf_initial_point.ansatz = your_ucc_ansatz
      initial_point = hf_initial_point.to_numpy_array()

    UVCC with VSCF initial point:

    .. code-block:: python

      vscf_initial_point = VSCFInitialPoint()
      vscf_initial_point.ansatz = your_uvcc_ansatz
      initial_point = vscf_initial_point.to_numpy_array()
