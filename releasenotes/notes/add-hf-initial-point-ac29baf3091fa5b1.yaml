    Adds Hartree-Fock (HF) and vibrational self-consistent field (VSCF) initial point classes.
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.algorithms.initial_points.HFInitialPoint` and
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.algorithms.initial_points.VSCFInitialPoint`, are to be used with
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.circuit.library.UCC`, and :class:`~qiskit_nature.circuit.library.UVCC`,
    respectively.

    This follows the introduction of
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.algorithms.initial_points.MP2InitialPoint` for computing the initial
    point using the Møller-Plesset 2nd Order (MP2) corrections.

    :class:`~qiskit_nature.algorithms.initial_points.MP2InitialPoint`,
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.algorithms.initial_points.HFInitialPoint`, and
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.algorithms.initial_points.VSCFInitialPoint` all inherit from the abstract
    base class :class:`~qiskit_nature.algorithms.initial_points.InitialPoint`.

    These initial points are intended to be used as starting VQE parameters when using a UCC ansatz
    (cluster operator coefficients). This should introduce an initial point that is closer to the
    ground state point, leading to fewer overall evaluations for VQE.

    Instances of the appropriate classes are now the default :attr:`initial_point` arguments in
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.algorithms.VQEUCCFactory` and
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.algorithms.VQEUVCCFactory`. Additionally, one may pass an explicit
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.algorithms.initial_points.InitialPoint` instance to the factories.
    Following are some example snippets.

    VQE UCC with a HFInitialPoint:

    .. code-block:: python

      hf_intial_point = HFInitialPoint()
      vqe_ucc_factory = VQEUCCFactory(quantum_instance, initial_point=hf_initial_point)

    VQE UCC with an MP2InitialPoint:

    .. code-block:: python

      mp2_intial_point = MP2InitialPoint()
      vqe_ucc_factory = VQEUCCFactory(quantum_instance, initial_point=mp2_initial_point)
      
    VQE UVCC with a VSCFInitialPoint:

    .. code-block:: python

      vscf_intial_point = VSCFInitialPoint()
      vqe_uvcc_factory = VQEUVCCFactory(quantum_instance, initial_point=vscf_initial_point)
    
    They can also be used by following the snippets below and passing the result via
    ``initial_point`` to the VQE.

    UCC with a HF initial point:

    .. code-block:: python

      hf_intial_point = HFInitialPoint()
      hf_initial_point.ansatz = your_ucc_ansatz
      initial_point = hf_initial_point.to_numpy_array()

    UVCC with a VSCF initial point:

    .. code-block:: python

      vscf_initial_point = VSCFInitialPoint()
      vscf_initial_point.ansatz = your_uvcc_ansatz
      initial_point = vscf_initial_point.to_numpy_array()
