    Following the MP2 T2 and energy correction calculation fix, the APIs for 
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.algorithms.initial_points.MP2InitialPoint` and
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.algorithms.initial_points.HFInitialPoint` have been changed
    slightly. After setting the ``grouped_property``, the ``total_energy`` and ``energy_correction``
    are now accessed via their respective properties, rather than via ``get_energy`` and 
    ``get_energy_correction``.

    Fixed the MP2 T2 amplitudes and energy correction computation to ensure it matches the result
    from PySCF.
