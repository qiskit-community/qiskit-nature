deprecations:
  - |
    The utility methods building out the ``QEOM`` hopping operators have been
    moved away from the ``BaseProblem`` interface and have been attached to the
    ``QEOM`` implementation itself.
features:
  - |
    The supported ``excitation`` types in the QEOM code have been updated. It now
    exposes the full set of excitation generation functionalities provided by
    the internally used UCC and UVCC ansatze. In particular, this means that
    rather than providing a custom list of excitation tuples, a function can be
    set by the user which generates such a custom list.
    The documentation has been updated accordingly to reflect this in all places.
