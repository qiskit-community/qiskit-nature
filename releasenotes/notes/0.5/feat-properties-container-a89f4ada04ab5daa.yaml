    Adds the :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.problems.PropertiesContainer` and
    its subclasses to simplify the handling of ``SparseLabelOpsFactory`` instances
    inside of problems. This container is a ``MutableSet`` and enforces at most
    a single instance of any Property kind to be stored inside of it This is
    sufficient for all application purposes of the auxiliary operators (which
    are generated by these objects).

    .. code-block:: python

        from qiskit_nature.second_q.problems import ElectronicPropertiesContainer
        from qiskit_nature.second_q.properties import ParticleNumber

        container = ElectronicPropertiesContainer()

        container.particle_number = ParticleNumber(10, 10)
        print(ParticleNumber in container)  # True

        container.particle_number = None
        print(ParticleNumber in container)  # False

        class MyCustomProperty:
            # implements the SparseLabelOpsFactory protocol
            ...

        custom = MyCustomProperty()
        container.add(custom)
        print(custom in container)  # True

        container.discard(MyCustomProperty)
        print(custom in container)  # False
