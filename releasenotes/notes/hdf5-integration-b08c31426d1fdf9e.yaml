    Adds a new HDF5-integration to support storing and loading of (mostly)
    Property objects using HDF5 files. A similar feature existed in the legacy
    QMolecule object but the new implementation is handled more general to
    enable leveraging this integration throughout more parts of the stack in the
    future.

    To store a driver result of the new drivers in a file you can do:

    .. code-block:: python

        from qiskit_nature.hdf5 import save_to_hdf5

        my_driver_result = driver.run()
        save_to_hdf5(my_driver_result, "my_driver_result.hdf5")

    and to load it again you would do:

    .. code-block:: python

        from qiskit_nature.hdf5 import load_from_hdf5

        my_driver_result = load_from_hdf5("my_driver_result.hdf5")
