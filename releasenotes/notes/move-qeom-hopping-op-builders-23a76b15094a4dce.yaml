deprecations:
  - |
    The utility methods building out the `QEOM` hopping operators have been
    moved away from the `BaseProblem` interface and have been attached to the
    `QEOM` implementation itself.
    From an end-user perspective, this should not change anything.
fixes:
  - |
    The documentation of the supported `excitations` types in the QEOM code has
    been corrected.
