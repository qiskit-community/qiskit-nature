    Qiskit Nature 0.5 comes with a major redesign of the :class:`.BaseProblem`
    layer of its stack. Rather than being tightly integrating both, drivers and
    transformers, problems are now a lot more standalone containers, being
    generated by the various drivers (or built out by a user to their custom
    needs directly).
    A detailed migration guide will be provided below.
features:
  - |
    Compared to the old initialization:

    .. code-block:: python

      problem = ElectronicStructureProblem(driver, [transformer])

    the new design works as follows:

    .. code-block:: python

      problem = driver.to_problem(include_dipole=True)

      reduced_problem = transformer.transform(problem)

    The `properties` concept has been largely redesigned and is a lot more
    refined now.
  - |
    The new :class:`.Hamiltonian` concept has been introduced, which gives the
    main operators more visibility over auxiliary observables, generated by the
    aforementioned `properties`.
