    Adds the method 
    :meth:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.problems.BaseProblem.get_tapered_mapper()` to
    transform a :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.mappers.QubitMapper` instance into a 
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.mappers.TaperedQubitMapper` based on the properties of the current
    problem.

    Update API for the method
    :meth:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.problems.BaseProblem.symmetry_sector_locator()`
    to accept ``Z2Symmetries`` as defined in the quantum_info module as well as the ``Z2Symmetries``
    defined in the opflow module.
