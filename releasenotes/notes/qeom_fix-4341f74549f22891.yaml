    Fixes QEOM such that when using parity mapping with two_qubit_reduction,
    or Z2 symmetries with any mapping, that the excited states are computed
    as expected.

    Fix the electronic structor problem sector locator such that the 'auto'
    Z2 symmetry conversion, of the qubit convertor, results in the ground state
    for such problems and not some other value due to incorrect sector selection.
