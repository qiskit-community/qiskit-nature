    Adds the :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.problems.PropertiesContainer` and
    its subclasses to simplify the handling of `Property` instances inside of
    problems. This container is a `MutableSet` and enforces at most a single
    instance of any Property kind to be stored inside of it This is sufficient
    for all application purposes of the auxiliary operators (which are generated
    by these objects).

    .. code-block:: python

        from qiskit_nature.second_q.problems import ElectronicPropertiesContainer
        from qiskit_nature.second_q.properties import ParticleNumber, Property

        container = ElectronicPropertiesContainer()

        container.particle_number = ParticleNumber(10, 10)
        print(ParticleNumber in container)  # True

        container.particle_number = None
        print(ParticleNumber in container)  # False

        class MyCustomProperty(Property):
            ...

        custom = MyCustomProperty()
        container.add(custom)
        print(custom in container)  # True

        container.discard(MyCustomProperty)
        print(custom in container)  # False
