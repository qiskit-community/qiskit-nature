features:
  - |
    The new keyword argument ``register_length`` has been added to the
    :meth:`.QubitMapper.map` method. This allows the user to set the length of a
    :class:`.SparseLabelOp` before mapping it (since this length is a lower bound).
deprecations:
  - |
    :attr:`.QubitMapper.allows_two_qubit_reduction` has been deprecated. There
    is no replacement because it is no longer needed in the new design.
  - |
    All arguments in the :class:`.QubitMapper` API (and its subclasses) which
    were previously called ``nmodes`` have been renamed to ``register_length``.
