upgrade:
  - |
    The `EvolvedOperatorAnsatz`, from the circuit.library in Nature, which was migrated in
    an earlier release to core Qiskit i.e. Terra, has now been removed. You should change
    any code that still uses this over to the core Qiskit one, from `qiskit.circuit.library`,
    as a direct replacement.
