    The symmetry folding and unfolding routines listed below could become severe
    bottlenecks for larger system sizes. Now, when PySCF is installed, its routine will be
    used which is significantly faster.

    - :func:`.unfold_s4_to_s1`
    - :func:`.unfold_s8_to_s1`
    - :func:`.unfold_s8_to_s4`
    - :func:`.fold_s1_to_s4`
    - :func:`.fold_s1_to_s8`
    - :func:`.fold_s4_to_s8`
