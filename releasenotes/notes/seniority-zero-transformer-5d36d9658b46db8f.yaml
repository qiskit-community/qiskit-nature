    Add :class:`~qiskit_nature.transformers.second_quantization.electronic.SeniorityZeroTransformer` 
    to transform a chemistry problem in second quantization to the restricted Hartree-Fock 
    formalism. The restricted approximation of a many-body Hamiltonian models electrons 
    as pairs instead of individual fermions and thus reduces the number of required qubits 
    by a factor of two. Alternatively, one can keep the number of qubits fixed and use a 
    bigger molecular basis set. The cost of the approximation is a loss in accuracy as we 
    neglect single-electron excitations.

    In the restricted formalism the Hamiltonian is no longer fermionic, but behaves like 
    a bosonic operator. For the mapping to a qubit operator we therefore have to use a
    suitable mapper (e.g. :class:`~qiskit_nature.mappers.second_quantization.DirectMapper`).

    Example how to use the 
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.transformers.second_quantization.electronic.SeniorityZeroTransformer`:

    .. code-block:: python

        from qiskit_nature.converters.second_quantization import QubitConverter
        from qiskit_nature.drivers import Molecule
        from qiskit_nature.drivers.second_quantization import (
          ElectronicStructureDriverType, 
          ElectronicStructureMoleculeDriver,
        )
        from qiskit_nature.mappers.second_quantization import DirectMapper
        from qiskit_nature.problems.second_quantization import ElectronicStructureProblem
        from qiskit_nature.transformers.second_quantization.electronic import SeniorityZeroTransformer

        molecule = Molecule(geometry=[["H", [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]], ["H", [0.0, 0.0, 0.8]]], charge=0, multiplicity=1)
        driver = ElectronicStructureMoleculeDriver(
            molecule, basis="sto3g", driver_type=ElectronicStructureDriverType.PYSCF)

        problem = ElectronicStructureProblem(driver, transformers=[SeniorityZeroTransformer()])
        converter = QubitConverter(DirectMapper())

        qubit_op = converter.convert(problem.second_q_ops()[0])
