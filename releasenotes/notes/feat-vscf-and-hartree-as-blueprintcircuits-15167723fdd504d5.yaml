    Implements both :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.circuit.library.HartreeFock` and
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.circuit.library.VSCF` as subclasses of
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.BlueprintCircuit`. This allows the respective classes to be
    instantiated without explicitly setting all of their instance attributes. Missing
    attributes can be set at a later point to complete the respective circuit definitions.

    .. code-block:: python

      from qiskit_nature.second_q.circuit.library import HartreeFock, VSCF
      from qiskit_nature.second_q.mappers import JordanWignerMapper, QubitConverter

      # Initialize Hartree-Fock initial_state without specifying
      # the number of particles and qubit converter.
      hf_state = HartreeFock(num_spatial_orbitals=4)

      # ...

      # complete circuit definition by specifying the rest of the instance attributes
      hf_state.qubit_converter = QubitConverter(JordanWignerMapper())
      hf_state.num_particles = (1,1)

      # ...

      # Similarly for VSCF
      vscf_state = VSCF()

      # ...

      # complete circuit definition by specifying the rest of the instance attributes
      vscf_state.num_modals = [2, 2]
