    Rename the runtime "program" to runtime "client" to avoid name confusions and
    reflect the fact that it is an interface for code executed in the cloud. The classes
    :class:`~qiskit_optimization.runtime.VQEProgram` and
    :class:`~qiskit_optimization.runtime.VQEProgramResult` have been renamed to
    :class:`~qiskit_optimization.runtime.VQEClient`,
    :class:`~qiskit_optimization.runtime.VQERuntimeResult`, respectively.
