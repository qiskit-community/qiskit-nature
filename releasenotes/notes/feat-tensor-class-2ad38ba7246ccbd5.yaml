features:
  - |
    Adds the new :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.operators.Tensor` class used
    internally to consistently deal with n-dimensional tensors throughout the
    stack.
  - |
    Adds the new :attr:`~qiskit_nature.settings.tensor_wrapping` setting which
    may be set to ``True`` to enable automatic wrapping of any n-dimensional
    tensor stored inside a
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.operators.PolynomialTensor` into a
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.operators.Tensor` instance.
deprecations:
  - |
    Deprecated the default value (``False``) of
    :attr:`~qiskit_nature.settings.tensor_wrapping` meaning that in the future
    :meth:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.operators.PolynomialTensor.__getitem__` will
    return objects of type :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.operators.Tensor`.
