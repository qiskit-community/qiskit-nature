    Three new methods for creating instances
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.properties.ElectronicDensity` have been
    added:

    1. constructing an empty (or all-zero) density of a given size:

       .. code-block:: python

         empty = ElectronicDensity.empty(num_spatial_orbitals=4)

    2. constructing an identity density, meaning that the 1-body matrices are
       initialized with identity matrices

       .. code-block:: python

         identity = ElectronicDensity.identity(num_spatial_orbitals=4)

    3. constructing from a provided number of particles. This is a shorter
       variant of the already existing ``from_orbital_occupation`` method for the
       most common use-case.

       .. code-block:: python

         num_spatial_orbitals = 4
         num_particles = (2, 2)

         two_and_two = ElectronicDensity.from_particle_number(num_spatial_orbitals, num_particles)

         # for example now the 1-body matrices will be:
         #   [[1, 0, 0, 0],
         #    [0, 1, 0, 0],
         #    [0, 0, 0, 0],
         #    [0, 0, 0, 0]]

    All of the methods above take the optional keyword-argument ``include_rdm2``
    which determines whether or not the 2-body matrices are computed based on the
    constructed 1-body matrices. By default, this is set to ``True``.
