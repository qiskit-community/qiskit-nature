    Fixes: :class:`~qiskit_nature.algorithms.per_samplers.boper_sampler.BOPESSampler` doed not support MinimumEigensolverFactories.
    Now, the factory can be used as following:

    .. code-block:: python

        solver = GroundStateEigensolver(converter, VQEUCCFactory(quantum_instance))
        sampler = BOPESSampler(solver, bootstrap=True, num_bootstrap=None, extrapolator=None)
