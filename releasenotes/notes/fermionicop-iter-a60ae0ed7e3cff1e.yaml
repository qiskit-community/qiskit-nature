    FermionicOp is now iterable. Iterating a FermionicOp yields
    (term, coefficient) pairs describing the terms contained in the operator.
    Each term is a list of tuples of the form (action, index), where the action
    is either "+" or "-" and the index is the integer index of the factor in
    the term.
