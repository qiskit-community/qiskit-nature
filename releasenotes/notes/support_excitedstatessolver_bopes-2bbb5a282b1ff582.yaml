    Minor changes in the ExcitedStatesEigensolver and in BOPESSampler to allow the 
    sampling of nuclear coordinates for the calculation of excited state energies 
    In addition to the ground state energy.
    
features:
  - |
    The BOPESSampler can now take a 'Union[GroundStateSolver, ExcitedStatesSolver]' instead
    of only a 'GroundStateSolver'. This generalizes the sampling of nuclear coordinates for 
    Born Oppenheimer Potential Energy Surfaces of excited states.
upgrade:
  - |
    The tutorial 05_Sampling_potential_energy_surfaces now includes calculations of excited state Born Oppenheimer potential energy surfaces
other:
  - |
    The solve() method of ExcitedStatesEigensolver was split in a get_qubit_operators() and solve() to match the GroundStatesEigensolver.
