features:
  - |
    The solver of BOPESSampler now accepts solvers of type
    `Union[GroundStateSolver,ExcitedStatesSolver]` instead of only a `GroundStateSolver`. 
    This generalizes to excited states the sampling 
    of nuclear coordinates for Born Oppenheimer Potential Energy Surfaces.
    Adds the `get_qubit_operators()` in
    :class:`qiskit_nature.algorithms.ExcitedStatesEigensolver`
    This matches the format of
    :class:`qiskit_nature.algorithms.GroundStatesEigensolver`
    BOPESSampler now also accepts auxiliary operators to pass to the solver.
    Geometry-dependent observable can also be defined as auxiliaries

upgrade:
  - |
    The tutorial 05 now includes calculations of excited state Born Oppenheimer potential energy
    surfaces.
