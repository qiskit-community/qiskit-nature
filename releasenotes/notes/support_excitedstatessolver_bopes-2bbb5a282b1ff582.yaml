    The solver of BOPESSampler now accepts solvers of type
    `Union[GroundStateSolver,ExcitedStatesSolver]` instead of only a `GroundStateSolver`. 
    This generalizes to excited states the sampling 
    of nuclear coordinates for Born Oppenheimer Potential Energy Surfaces.
    Adds the `get_qubit_operators()` in
    :class:`qiskit_nature.algorithms.ExcitedStatesEigensolver`.
    This matches the format of
    :class:`qiskit_nature.algorithms.GroundStatesEigensolver`.
    BOPESSampler now also accepts auxiliary operators to pass to the solver.
    Geometry-dependent observable can also be defined as auxiliaries.
    See the `Sampling the potential energy surface <tutorials/05_Sampling_potential_energy_surfaces.ipynb>`_ tutorial
    for a demonstration of how to use this calculation of excited state Born Oppenheimer potential energy
    surfaces.
