    The solver of BOPESSampler is now of type `Union[GroundStateSolver, ExcitedStatesSolver]` 
    instead of only a `GroundStateSolver`. This generalizes to excited states the sampling 
    of nuclear coordinates for Born Oppenheimer Potential Energy Surfaces.
    Adds the `get_qubit_operators()` in
    :class:`qiskit_nature.algorithms.ExcitedStatesEigensolver`
    This matches the format of
    :class:`qiskit_nature.algorithms.GroundStatesEigensolver`

    The tutorial 05 now includes calculations of excited state Born Oppenheimer potential energy
    surfaces.
