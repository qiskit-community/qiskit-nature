    Adds a new lattice class, :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.hamiltonians.lattices.HexagonalLattice`
    for the generation of hexagonal lattices.

    You construct a hexagonal lattice by specifying the number of rows and columns of hexagons.
    You can also specify the edge- and on-site-parameters.

    Below is a simple example to illustrate this:

    .. code-block:: python

        from qiskit_nature.second_q.hamiltonians.lattices import HexagonalLattice

        lattice = HexagonalLattice(
            2,
            3,
            edge_parameter=1.0,
            onsite_parameter=1.5,
        )
