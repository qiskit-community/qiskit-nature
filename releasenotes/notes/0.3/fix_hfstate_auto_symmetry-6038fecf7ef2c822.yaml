    In order to fix the
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.problems.second_quantization.ElectronicStructureProblem`
    :meth:`~qiskit_nature.problems.second_quantization.ElectronicStructureProblem.symmetry_sector_locator`
    information on the mapping was required and the
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.converters.second_quantization.QubitConverter` ``sector_locator``
    parameter callback signature of the
    :meth:`~qiskit_nature.converters.second_quantization.QubitConverter.convert` method was
    changed from ``sector_locator: Optional[Callable[[Z2Symmetries], Optional[List[int]]]]``
    to ``sector_locator: Optional[Callable[[Z2Symmetries, "QubitConverter"], Optional[List[int]]]]``
    i.e. your supplied callback method must now take a second parameter which is a
    ``QubitConverter`` instance and when invoked will be the instance upon which the ``convert``
    was called. If you have created your own sector locator then you will need to update it`s
    signature otherwise the code will fail when calling it now.

    Fixes the creation on the :class:`~qiskit_nature.circuit.library.HartreeFock`
    initial state which could fail when Z2Symettry reduction was being used via the
    provided :class:`~qiskit_nature.converters.second_quantization.QubitConverter`.

    Also fixes the :class:`~qiskit_nature.problems.second_quantization.ElectronicStructureProblem`
    :meth:`~qiskit_nature.problems.second_quantization.ElectronicStructureProblem.symmetry_sector_locator`,
    which uses the HartreeFock class too, so that it correctly determines the sector
    containing the ground state when ``auto`` symmetry reduction is used.
