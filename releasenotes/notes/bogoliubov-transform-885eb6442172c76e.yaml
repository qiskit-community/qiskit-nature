    Adds :class:`~.BogoliubovTransform`.
    This class constructs a circuit that performs a Bogoliubov transform,
    which is a single-particle basis change that may or may not conserve
    particle number. See the
    "Quadratic Hamiltonians and Slater determinants" tutorial
    for a demonstration of how to use this class.
