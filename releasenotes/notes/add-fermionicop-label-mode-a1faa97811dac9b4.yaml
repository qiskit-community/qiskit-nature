  - |
    The internal data in :class:`~qiskit_nature.operators.second_quantization.FermionicOp`
    have been changed. As a result, more data type is now accepted by initialize.
    The ascending order constraint and the no-same index constraint have been removed.
    In addition, the dense and sparse labels are now automatically detected by the existence of
    underscores.

    `label_display_mode` of :class:`~qiskit_nature.operators.second_quantization.FermionicOp` is
    added. There are two modes `dense` and `sparse`.
    This mode can be switched by class method
    :meth:`~qiskit_nature.operators.second_quantization.FermionicOp.set_label_display_mode()`.
