  - |
    The internal data in :class:`~qiskit_nature.operators.second_quantization.FermionicOp`
    have been changed. As a result, more data type is now accepted by initialize.
    The ascending order constraint and the no-same index constraint have been removed.
    In addition, the dense and sparse labels are now automatically detected by the existence of
    underscores.

    The property `display_format` of :class:`~qiskit_nature.operators.second_quantization.FermionicOp`
    is added. There are two modes `dense` and `sparse`.
    This display format can be switched by the property `FermionicOp.display_format`.
