    Add a type check for the input graphs to
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.problems.second_quantization.lattice.lattices.Lattice`
    which asserts that the edge weights of the graph are either numeric (or one of `None` or `{}`
    which is replaced by a unit weight). This prevents possibly unexpected errors in the
    application stack when an operator is constructed from the lattice.

    In particular, the following now raises a `ValueError`:

    .. code-block:: python

        from retworkx import PyGraph
        from qiskit_nature.problems.second_quantization.lattice import Lattice

        graph = PyGraph(multigraph=False)
        graph.add_nodes_from(range(3))
        graph.add_edges_from([(0, 1, 1), (1, 2, "banana")])  # banana is not a valid weight!

        lattice = Lattice(graph)
