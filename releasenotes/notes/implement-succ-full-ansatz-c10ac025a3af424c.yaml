    Introduced a new feature SUCCfull, that adds succ_full ansatz to
    ``UCC`` objects. It can be used by using the ``SUCCfull`` function,
    for example::

      from qiskit_nature.circuit.library.ansatzes import SUCCfull
      from qiskit_nature.converters.second_quantization import QubitConverter
      from qiskit_nature.mappers.second_quantization import JordanWignerMapper
      converter = QubitConverter(JordanWignerMapper())
      ansatz = SUCCfull(converter, (1, 1), 6)
