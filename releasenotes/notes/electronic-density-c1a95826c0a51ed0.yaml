    Adds a new Property for the electronic structure stack to evaluate the 1-
    and 2-body reduced density matrices. Assuming that you already have an
    instance of your :class:`qiskit_nature.second_q.problems.ElectronicStructureProblem`,
    you can add the :class:`qiskit_nature.second_q.properties.ElectronicDensity`
    to it like so:

    .. code-block:: python

      problem: ElectronicStructureProblem = ...

      from qiskit_nature.second_q.properties import ElectronicDensity

      # initialize the density in an orthonormal basis simply based on the
      # orbital occupation numbers
      alpha_occupation = [1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]
      beta_occupation = [1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0]

      problem.properties.electronic_density = ElectronicDensity.from_orbital_occupation(
        alpha_occupation, beta_occupation
      )
