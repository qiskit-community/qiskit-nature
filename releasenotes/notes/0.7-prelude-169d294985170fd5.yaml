  Qiskit Nature has been migrated from the `Qiskit Github organization <https://github.com/Qiskit>`_ to
  the `qiskit-community Github organization <https://github.com/qiskit-community>`_.
  This reflects the fact, that Qiskit Nature is `not` part of Qiskit and is `not` maintained by IBM Quantum.
  Rather, it is a community-driven project which builds upon Qiskit.

  To reflect this significant change and because we are onboarding additional codeowners and maintainers,
  with this version (0.7) we have decided to *remove all deprecated* code, regardless of time of its deprecation.
  This ensures that the new members of the development team do not have a large bulk of legacy code to maintain,
  which they do not know a lot about and for which they were not involved in the discussions that led to its
  deprecation.

  This can mean one of two things for you as the end-user:

    #. Nothing, if you already migrated your code and no longer rely on any deprecated features.

    #. Otherwise, you need to migrate your code immediately. If you cannot do that, or want to continue using some
       of the features that were removed, you should pin your version of Qiskit Nature to 0.6
