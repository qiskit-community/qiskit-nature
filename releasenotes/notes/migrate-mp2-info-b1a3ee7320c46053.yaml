    Adds a class to compute the Moller-Plesset 2nd Order (MP2) corrections.
    The corresponding double-excitation coefficients are intended to be used as
    an initial point for the VQE parameters (cluster operator coefficients)
    when using a UCC ansatz. This should introduce an initial point that is
    closer to the ground state point, leading to fewer overall evaluations
    for VQE.

    :class:`~qiskit_nature.algorithms.MP2InitialPoint` inherits from the
    abstract base class (interface)
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.algorithms.InitialPoint`, which takes a driver
    result and a UCC ansatz via the ``get_initial_point`` method.

    The MP2 computation requires the number of spin orbitals and the electronic
    energy from the second quantized properties of the driver result. The
    electronic energy must contain the ``orbital_energies`` for a valid
    calculation. If this is missing an error will be raised.

    When using :class:`~qiskit_nature.algorithms.VQEUCCFactory`, an
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.algorithms.MP2InitialPoint` object can be passed via
    the ``initial_point`` keyword argument:

    .. code-block:: python

      mp2 = MP2InitialPoint()
      vqe_ucc_factory = VQEUCCFactory(quantum_instance, initial_point=mp2)

    In this case the driver result and ansatz will be used to compute the
    initial point automatically. This will then be passed to the VQE.

    Outside of the factory, one can do this manually:

    .. code-block:: python

      mp2 = MP2InitialPoint()
      initial_point = mp2.get_initial_point(driver_result, ansatz)

      algorithm = VQE(
        ansatz,
        optimizer=optimizer,
        quantum_instance=quantum_instance,
        initial_point=initial_point
      )

    The eventual intention is to retire ``preferred_init_points`` from ``VQE``
    in Terra, so the implementation avoids this property.
