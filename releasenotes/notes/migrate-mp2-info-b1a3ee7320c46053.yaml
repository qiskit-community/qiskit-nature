    Adds a class to compute the Moller-Plesset 2nd Order corrections. The
    corresponding double-excitation coefficients are intended to be used as
    an initial point for VQE when using a UCC ansatz. This should introduce
    an initial point that is closer to the ground state point, leading to fewer
    overall evaluations for VQE.

    To instantiate `~qiskit_nature.algorithms.MP2PointGenerator`, it requires the
    number of spin orbitals, the electronic energy, and the excitation lists
    from the second-quantized properties returned by the driver.

    If using a :class:`~qiskit_nature.algorithms.VQEUCCfactory`, one can set
    `initial_point="MP2"` and :class:`~qiskit_nature.algorithms.MP2PointGenerator`
    will be built within the factory using the same excitations as
    `~qiskit_nature.circuit.library.UCC` automatically. This initial point will
    then be passed to VQE.

    Outside of the factory, one can pass the initial point for VQE by manually
    getting the excitation list from UCC and instantiating
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.algorithms.MP2PointGenerator` with it and the relevant
    results from the driver.
