    Due to the initial points now requiring the ``reps`` from the ansatz, the ``excitation_list``
    can no longer be set directly using public property, but only via the ``ansatz`` property.
  - |
    Fix the initial point classes to account for the number of times the evolved operators are
    repeated in the ansatz.
