deprecations:
  - |
    The :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.mappers.QubitConverter` class is
    deprecated in favor of using the :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.mappers.QubitMapper`
    implementations directly.
    As a consequence of this, all public properties and function arguments which
    referred to the ``QubitConverter`` by name (e.g. ``qubit_converter``) have
    been deprecated in favor of properties and function arguments referring to
    ``QubitMapper`` (e.g. ``qubit_mapper``), respectively.
  - |
    The :meth:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.problems.BaseProblem.symmetry_sector_locator`
    method has been deprecated without a direct replacement. This utility is no
    longer needed in the new workflow which uses
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.mappers.QubitMapper` instances directly.
    Qubit tapering can instead now be done using the
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.mappers.TaperedQubitMapper` which can be
    constructed easily using the
    :meth:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.problems.BaseProblem.get_tapered_mapper`
    method.
  - |
    The ``match_convert`` argument of the
    :meth:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.circuit.library.initial_states.hartree_fock.hartree_fock_bitstring_mapped`
    method has been deprecated without replacement. This utility is no longer
    needed in the new workflow which uses
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.mappers.QubitMapper` instances directly.
