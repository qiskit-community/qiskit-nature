    Adds the :mod:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.operators.symmetric_two_body` module.
    This module provides utilities to exploit the inherent symmetries of
    chemistry-ordered two-body electronic integrals. You may use these to reduce
    memory consumption of your code, for example like so:

    .. code-block:: python

       from pyscf import gto
       from qiskit_nature.second_q.hamiltonians import ElectronicEnergy
       from qiskit_nature.second_q.operators import (
            ElectronicIntegrals,
            PolynomialTensor,
       )
       from qiskit_nature.second_q.operators.symmetric_two_body import S8Integrals

       mol = gto.M(atom="H 0 0 0; H 0 0 0.735", basis="631g*")

       hamiltonian = ElectronicEnergy(
           ElectronicIntegrals(
               PolynomialTensor(
                   {
                       "+-": mol.get_hcore(),
                       "++--": S8Integrals(mol.intor("int2e", aosym=8)),
                   },
                   validate=False,
               )
           )
       )

       print(hamiltonian.second_q_op())

    Since these integral containers are integrated into the stack, you can
    continue to use existing tools such as the
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.transformers.BasisTransformer` or even the
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.transformers.ActiveSpaceTransformer` as if
    you had stored your integrals in standard arrays.

    Adds the :attr:`~qiskit_nature.settings.use_symmetry_reduced_integrals` setting.
    When set to ``True``, this will cause objects like for example the
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.formats.fcidump.FCIDump`,
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.formats.qcschema.QCSchema`, or
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.drivers.PySCFDriver` to attempt and leverage
    the :mod:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.operators.symmetric_two_body` module in
    order to reduce the memory requirements at runtime.
deprecations:
  - |
    Deprecates ``np.ndarray`` as the return type of the
    :attr:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.formats.fcidump.FCIDump.hijkl`,
    :attr:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.formats.fcidump.FCIDump.hijkl_ba`, and
    :attr:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.formats.fcidump.FCIDump.hijkl_bb` attributes.
    Instead, these will always be
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.operators.symmetric_two_body.SymmetricTwoBodyIntegrals`.
    Instances of the latter can be used as ``np.ndarray`` so in terms of functionality
    this should not change anything. However, ``isinstance(integrals, np.ndarray)`` will *not*
    return ``True`` for ``integrals`` of type ``SymmetricTwoBodyIntegrals``.
    Additionally, the three ``FCIDump`` attributes will no longer accept physicist-ordered
    two-body tensors in the future.
