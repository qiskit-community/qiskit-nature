    The commutator methods :meth:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.operators.commutators.commutator`,
    :meth:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.operators.commutators.anti_commutator`, and
    :meth:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.operators.commutators.double_commutator` no longer faultily
    simplify the returned operator (i.e. the absolute tolerance during simplification is set to zero
    instead of defaulting to ``SparseLabelOp.atol``).
