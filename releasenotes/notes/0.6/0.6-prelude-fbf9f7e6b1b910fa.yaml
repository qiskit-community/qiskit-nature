    Qiskit Nature 0.6 focuses on refactoring of the :mod:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.mappers`
    module. To that extent, the :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.mappers.QubitConverter`
    class has been deprecated in favor of using the various subclasses of
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.mappers.QubitMapper` directly.
    As a short example, while you were doing something similar to this until now:


    .. code-block:: python

      solver = GroundStateEigensolver(
          QubitConverter(ParityMapper(), two_qubit_reduction=True),
          VQE(...),
      )
      result = solver.solve(problem)

    you now simply do the following instead:


    .. code-block:: python

      solver = GroundStateEigensolver(
          ParityMapper(num_particles=problem.num_particles),
          VQE(...),
      )
      result = solver.solve(problem)

    Check out the `migration guide for the QubitConverter
    <https://qiskit-community.github.io/qiskit-nature/migration/0.6_c_qubit_converter.html>`_
    for more details.

    Besides this major refactoring, a few other changes have been done, so be sure
    to check out the `migration guide from 0.5 to 0.6
    <https://qiskit-community.github.io/qiskit-nature/migration/index.html#migrating-from-0-5-to-0-6>`_.
