features:
  - |
    Adds the new :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.operators.Tensor` class used
    internally to consistently deal with n-dimensional tensors throughout the
    stack. This class also exposes the
    :attr:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.operators.Tensor.label_template` which allows
    an end-user to influence the translation procedure implemented in
    :meth:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.operators.SparseLabelOp.from_polynomial_tensor`.
  - |
    Adds the new :attr:`~qiskit_nature.settings.tensor_unwrapping` setting which
    may be set to ``False`` to disable the unwrapping of internally created
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.operators.Tensor` objects stored inside of a
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.operators.PolynomialTensor`. See also
    :attr:`~qiskit_nature.settings.tensor_unwrapping` for more details.
deprecations:
  - |
    Deprecated the default value (``True``) of
    :attr:`~qiskit_nature.settings.tensor_unwrapping` meaning that in the future
    :meth:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.operators.PolynomialTensor.__getitem__` will
    return objects of type :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.operators.Tensor`.
