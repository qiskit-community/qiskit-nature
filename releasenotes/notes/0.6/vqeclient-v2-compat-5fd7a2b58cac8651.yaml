    Fix support of ``BackendV2`` in the :class:`.VQEClient`. Previously, backends instantiated
    with the ``IBMProvider`` failed since they return backends of type ``BackendV2``, which
    were not correctly supported in the VQE client. Backends instantiated with the ``IBMQ``
    provider continue to work as before.
