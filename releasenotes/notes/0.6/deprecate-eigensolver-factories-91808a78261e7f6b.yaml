    Deprecated all :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.algorithms.MinimumEigensolverFactory`
    and :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.algorithms.EigensolverFactory` classes.
    Instead, users should now build the respectively generated solver instances
    themselves. How-to guides to detail the involved steps have been added:

    - :ref:`Building a NumPyEigensolver <how-to-numpy>`
    - :ref:`Building a NumPyMinimumEigensolver <how-to-numpy-min>`
    - :ref:`Using a UCC-like ansatz with VQE <how-to-vqe-ucc>`
    - :ref:`Using a UVCC-like ansatz with VQE <how-to-vqe-uvcc>`
