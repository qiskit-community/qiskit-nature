features:
  - |
    The :class:`~qiskit_nature.operators.SecondQuantizedOp` now has a method
    :meth:`~qiskit_nature.operators.SecondQuantizedOp.is_hermitian()` method which will
    return ``True`` if the operator is equivalent to its adjoint and ``False`` otherwise

  - |
    :meth:`~qiskit_nature.operators.SecondQuantizedOp.to_list()` is now an abstract method of
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.operators.SecondQuantizedOp` that is implemented by all subclasses
