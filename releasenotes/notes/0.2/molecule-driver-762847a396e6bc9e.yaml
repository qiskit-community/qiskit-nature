    Introduces the :class:`~qiskit_nature.drivers.second_quantization.ElectronicStructureMoleculeDriver` and
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.drivers.second_quantization.VibrationalStructureMoleculeDriver`
    that allow for the creation of Molecule-based drivers by specifying a molecule plus basis and
    method (for Electronic Structure drivers only) and a driver type. An additional type `AUTO` allows for
    the lookup of the first driver installed that supports the given method. The documentation of
    those two molecule driver classes gives more details on it.
