    Fixes the compatibility of the fermionic excitation generator options which
    disables spin preserving while also enabling generalized behavior.
    Now, combining `generalized=True` with `preserve_spin=False` results in all
    combinations of excitations in the given spin orbital space. De-excitations
    are not included and filtered accordingly.
