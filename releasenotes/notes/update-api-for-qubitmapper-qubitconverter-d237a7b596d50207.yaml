    Updated the API to allow :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.mappers.QubitMapper` objects  in places
    where :class:`qiskit_nature.second_q.mappers.QubitConverter` were previously required. This addition 
    advances toward a future deprecation of :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.mappers.QubitConverter`. 
    All inputs of type :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.mappers.QubitConverter` now support
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.mappers.QubitMapper` objects implementing a transformation from 
    second quantized operators to Pauli operators. Note that the mappers currently do not support 
    qubit reduction techniques.

    Added a method ``map_all()`` to the class :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.mappers.QubitMapper` to
    allow the mapping of a list or dict of operators as the ``convert_match()`` does for the 
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.mappers.QubitConverter`.
