    Some minor issues in the :class:`~qiskit_nature.transformers.second_quantization.electronic.ActiveSpaceTransformer`
    were fixed. Namely:

    - iterated properties are no longer deep-copied resulting in non-transformed ones actually being dropped rather than carried on
    - the correct return type object is being constructed and returned
