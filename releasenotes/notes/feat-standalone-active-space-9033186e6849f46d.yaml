    Calling the :meth:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.transformers.ActiveSpaceTransformer.transform_hamiltonian`
    is now supported, provided that the active space has been prepared properly.

    .. code-block:: python

      # assuming we have the total Hamiltonian of our system available:
      total_hamiltonian = ElectronicEnergy(...)

      # now we want to reduce it to an active space of 2 electrons in 2 orbitals
      transformer = ActiveSpaceTransformer(2, 2)

      # assuming that our total system size is 10 electrons in 10 orbitals:
      transformer.prepare_active_space(10, 10)

      # after preparation, this now works as intended
      reduced_hamiltonian = transformer.transform_hamiltonian(total_hamiltonian)
