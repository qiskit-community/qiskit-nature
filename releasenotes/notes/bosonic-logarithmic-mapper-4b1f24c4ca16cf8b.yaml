    This release introduces a new mapper for the :class:`.BosonicOp`, the :class:`BosonicLogarithmicMapper`.
    It is more efficient both in terms of the number of qubits required and, for some operation, in the number of Pauli strings generated due
    to the binary encoding of the bosonic operator. For other operations, such as the hopping term
    :math:`a^\\dagger_i a_j`, the number of Pauli strings generated is bigger than the linear mapper.
    This mapper is based on this `paper <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2307.06580>`_.
    Below is an example of how one can use this mapper, assuming the existence of some :class:`.BosonicOp` instance called ``bos_op``:

    .. code-block:: python

      from qiskit_nature.second_q.mappers import BosonicLogarithmicMapper
      mapper = BosonicLogarithmicMapper(max_occupation=2)
      qubit_op = mapper.map(bos_op)
