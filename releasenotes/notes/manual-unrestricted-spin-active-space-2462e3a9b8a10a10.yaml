    The ``active_orbitals`` argument of the :class:`.ActiveSpaceTransformer` may now take
    a list of integers that is twice as long as the number of available spatial orbitals.
    In this case, the first half is treated as the alpha-spin indices and the second half
    as the beta-spin indices.
