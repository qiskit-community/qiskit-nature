    Adds a class to compute the MÃ¸ller-Plesset 2nd Order (MP2) corrections.
    The corresponding double-excitation coefficients are intended to be used as
    an initial point for the VQE parameters (cluster operator coefficients)
    when using a UCC ansatz. This should introduce an initial point that is
    closer to the ground state point, leading to fewer overall evaluations
    for VQE.

    :class:`~qiskit_nature.algorithms.MP2InitialPoint` inherits from the
    abstract base class (interface)
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.algorithms.InitialPoint`, which takes a driver
    result and a UCC ansatz either directly via the ``compute`` method or via
    their respective property setters.

    The MP2 computation requires the `grouped_property` to contain the
    ElectronicEnergy, which must contain the two-body molecular orbital matrix
    and the orbital energies. Optionally, it will also use the Hartree-Fock
    reference energy to compute the absolute energy.

    When using :class:`~qiskit_nature.algorithms.VQEUCCFactory`, an
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.algorithms.MP2InitialPoint` object can be passed via
    the ``initial_point`` keyword argument:

    .. code-block:: python

      mp2_initial_point = MP2InitialPoint()
      vqe_ucc_factory = VQEUCCFactory(quantum_instance, initial_point=mp2_initial_point)

    In this case the driver result and ansatz will be used to compute the
    initial point automatically. This will then be passed to the VQE.

    Outside of the factory, one can do this manually:

    .. code-block:: python

      mp2_initial_point = MP2InitialPoint()
      mp2_initial_point.compute(driver_result, ansatz)
      initial_point = mp2_initial_point.to_numpy_array()

      algorithm = VQE(
        ansatz,
        optimizer=optimizer,
        quantum_instance=quantum_instance,
        initial_point=initial_point
      )

    The eventual intention is to retire ``preferred_init_points`` from ``VQE``
    in Terra, so the implementation avoids this property.
