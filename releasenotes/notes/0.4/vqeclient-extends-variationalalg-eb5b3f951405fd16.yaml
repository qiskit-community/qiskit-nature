    :class:`~qiskit_nature.runtime.VQEClient` now extends 
    VariationalAlgorithm, meaning users can now implement 
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.algorithms.pes_samplers.BOPESSampler` 
    using bootstrapping, which works similarly now with VQEClient
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.runtime.VQEClient` as it did previously
    with local VQE.
