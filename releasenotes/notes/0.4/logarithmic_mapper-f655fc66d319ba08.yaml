    Adds :class:`qiskit_nature.mappers.second_quantization.LogarithmicMapper`.
    This class is a mapper for Logarithmic spin-to-qubit mapping. In this local encoding transformation, each individual spin S system is represented via
    the lowest lying 2S+1 states in a qubit system with the minimal number of qubits needed to
    represent >= 2S+1 distinct states.
