    Improves the performance of the
    :meth:`qiskit_nature.properties.second_quantization.electronic.integrals.ElectronicIntegrals.to_second_q_op`
    method significantly. Previously, generating the second quantized operators
    for a system size greater than 20 spin orbitals took on the order of minutes
    to hours (depending on the actual size). Now, even system sizes of 50 spin
    orbitals can be handled in a matter of seconds.
