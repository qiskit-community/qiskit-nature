features:
  - |
    The solver of :class:`~qiskit_nature.algorithms.pes_samplers.BOPESSampler` now accepts solvers of type
    `Union[GroundStateSolver,ExcitedStatesSolver]` instead of only a `GroundStateSolver`. 
    This generalizes to excited states the sampling 
    of nuclear coordinates for Born Oppenheimer Potential Energy Surfaces.
    Adds the `get_qubit_operators()` in :class:`qiskit_nature.algorithms.ExcitedStatesEigensolver`.
    This matches the format of :class:`qiskit_nature.algorithms.GroundStateEigensolver`.
    BOPESSampler now also accepts auxiliary operators to pass to the solver.
    Geometry-dependent observable can also be defined as auxiliaries.
    See the `Sampling the potential energy surface <tutorials/05_Sampling_potential_energy_surfaces.ipynb>`_ tutorial
    for a demonstration of how to use this calculation of excited state Born Oppenheimer potential energy surfaces.
deprecations:
  - |
    The argument `gss` of the constructor of :class:`~qiskit_nature.algorithms.pes_samplers.BOPESSampler` was deprecated 
    and replaced by `state_solver` to match the extension of this class to 
    :class:`qiskit_nature.algorithms.ExcitedStatesEigensolver`. 
    Now the constructor has the following positional argument:
    
    * state_solver
