    :class:`~qiskit_nature.circuit.library.ansatzes.UCC` and 
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.circuit.library.ansatzes.UVCC` when
    fully configured via the constructor failed to transpile and were not valid circuits.
    This fixes that to ensure that if `UCC` / `UVCC` are fully configured then as circuits
    they are are immediately valid from the get go.
