    Add the option to initialize a :class:`~qiskit_nature.problems.second_quantization.lattice.Lattice`
    from a ``networkx.Graph`` object, which will be internally converted to a ``retworkx.PyGraph``
    for performance. 

    For example, you can now construct a lattice as

    .. code-block:: python

        import networkx as nx
        from qiskit_nature.problems.second_quantization.lattice import Lattice

        # 3-regular random graph on 6 nodes
        graph = nx.generators.random_graphs.random_regular_graph(3, n=6)
        lattice = Lattice(graph)
