    The `ElectronicStructureResult` did not initialize the `_computed_dipole_moment` variable causing
    critical errors when trying to print a result from an algorithm which does not compute these
    observables. Proper initialization fixes this issue.
    Printing the result would also fail when `complex` numbers were stored. This has also been remedied.
