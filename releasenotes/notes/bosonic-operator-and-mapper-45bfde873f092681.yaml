    Introduced a new feature that implements the bosonic operator :class:`.BosonicOp`.
    Its functionalities are analogous to the :class:`.FermioniOp`, but for commuting bosonic particles.
    It should be used to represent a bosonic operator, so if one wants to represent the boson number
    operator it should do for example:

    .. code-block:: python

      from qiskit_nature.second_q.operators import BosonicOp
      bosonic_op = BosonicOp({'+_0 -_0': 1}, num_modes=1)

    Due to the nature of bosonic particles, this class uses the commutator relations instead of the
    anti-commutator ones (used by fermionic particles).

    In order to use the bosonic operator for quantum applications, this feature also introduces the
    bosonic linear mapper, which allows to map the BosonicOp to the qubit space. This mapper is based
    on `this paper <https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.3.043212>`.
    To use this mapper one can for example:

    .. code-block:: python

      from qiskit_nature.second_q.mappers import BosonicLinearMapper
      mapper = BosonicLinearMapper(truncation=1)
      qubit_op = mapper.map(bos_op)
