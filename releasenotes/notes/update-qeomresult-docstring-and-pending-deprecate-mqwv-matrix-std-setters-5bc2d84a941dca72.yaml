    Completed the missing docstrings for the new attributes of the
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.algorithms.excited_state_solvers.qeom.QEOMResult`.
  - |
    Extended the input type of 
    :meth:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.operators.commutators.commutator` and
    :meth:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.operators.commutators.anti_commutator` and 
    :meth:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.operators.commutators.double_commutator` to
    :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.SparsePauliOp`. They are now used in 
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.algorithms.excited_state_solvers.qeom.QEOM`. 


deprecations:
  - |
    The M, Q, W, V matrix standard deviation setters from
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.algorithms.excited_state_solvers.qeom.QEOMResult`
    were pending deprecated and remain computable from the H and S matrices.
