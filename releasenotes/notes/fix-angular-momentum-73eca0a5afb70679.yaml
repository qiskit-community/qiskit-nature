features:
  - |
    Added the :func:`.get_overlap_ab_from_qcschema` function which extracts the
    alpha-beta spin orbital overlap matrix from a :class:`.QCSchema` instance.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixes the following operators when dealing with non-orthonormal orbitals
    (for example when using unrestricted spin orbitals):
    - :class:`.AnglarMomentum`
    - :func:`.s_plus_operator`
    - :func:`.s_minus_operator`
    - :func:`.s_x_operator`
    - :func:`.s_y_operator`

    To make the fix take effect, the new additional `overlap` argument needs to
    be provided to all of these operators.

    Prior to this fix, none of the operators above were able to resolve any spin
    contamination and would yield misleadingly "clean" expectation values. See
    `this issue <https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-nature/issues/1273>`_
    for a more complete discussion.
