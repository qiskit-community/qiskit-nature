    Imaginary contributions to the UCC ansatz can be added along with the real contributions by 
    setting the boolean flag `include_imaginary` to True. When True, an extra ansatz parameter is
    added to each excitation that controls the imaginary contribution to its evolution. This
    setting then doubles the total number of ansatz parameters, as compared to the default setting
    of False.
