    The public :attr:`excitation_list` property has now been removed from
    :class:`qiskit_nature.second_q.algorithms.initial_points.HFInitialPoint`,
    :class:`qiskit_nature.second_q.algorithms.initial_points.MP2InitialPoint`, and
    :class:`qiskit_nature.second_q.algorithms.initial_points.VSCFInitialPoint`.
    Thus the excitation list cannot be set directly, and the private attribute
    :attr:`_excitation_list` is now set exclusively via the :attr:`ansatz` property.
