    The ``excitation_list`` property has been removed from
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.algorithms.initial_points.HFInitialPoint`,
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.algorithms.initial_points.MP2InitialPoint`, and
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.algorithms.initial_points.VSCFInitialPoint`. Thus the excitation
    list cannot be set directly, rather this must be set via the
    :attr:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.algorithms.initial_points.InitialPoint.ansatz`.
