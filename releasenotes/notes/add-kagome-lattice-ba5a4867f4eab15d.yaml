    Adds a new lattice class, :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.hamiltonians.lattices.KagomeLattice`
    for the generation of kagome lattices.

    For example, you can construct a kagome lattice with 4 and 3 unit cells in the x and y direction,
    respectively, which has weights 1.0 on all edges, weights 1.5 on self-loops and open boundary conditions

    .. code-block:: python

        from qiskit_nature.second_q.hamiltonians.lattices import (
            KagomeLattice,
            BoundaryCondition,
        )

        kagome = KagomeLattice(
            4,
            3,
            edge_parameter = 1.0,
            onsite_parameter = 1.5,
            boundary_condition = BoundaryCondition.OPEN
        )
