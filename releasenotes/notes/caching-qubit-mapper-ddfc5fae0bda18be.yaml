    The performance of the :class:`.QubitMapper`, when used to mapped multiple
    operators of identical size, is significantly improved, by means of caching
    the generated Pauli lookup list.
    However, this means that when using the same qubit mapper to map differently
    sized operators, the cache will need to be invalidated like so:

    .. code-block:: python

      from qiskit_nature.second_q.mappers import JordanWignerMapper
      from qiskit_nature.second_q.operators import FermionicOp

      mapper = JordanWignerMapper()

      fer_op1 = FermionicOp("N_0", register_length=2)
      qubit_op1 = mapper.map(fer_op1)

      mapper.invalidate_cache()

      fer_op2 = FermionicOp("N_0", register_length=4)
      qubit_op2 = mapper.map(fer_op2)
