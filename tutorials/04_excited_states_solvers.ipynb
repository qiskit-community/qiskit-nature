    "\n",
    "We also need to specify the number of eigenvalues to be computed by the `NumPyEigensolver`. For this particular system, we are interested in the ground and first three excited states, so we will set `k=4` (which defaults to 1 so be sure to set this, otherwise you will only obtain the ground state!)."
