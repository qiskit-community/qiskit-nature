    "Because the nuclei are much heavier than the electrons they do not move on the same time scale and therefore, the behavior of nuclei and electronc can be decoupled. This is the Born-Oppenheimer approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, a molecular wave function is factorized as a product of an electronic part, which is the solution of the electronic Schroedinger equation, and a vibro-rotational one, which is the solution of the nuclear Schroedinger equation in the potential energy surface (PES) generated by sampling the eigenvalues of the electronic Schroedinger equation for different geometries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nuclear Schroedinger equation is usually solved in two steps, in analogy with its electronic counterpart. \n",
    "A single-particle basis (the basis functions are called, in this case, modals) is obtained either by the harmonic approximation applied to the PES or from a vibrational self-consistent field (VSCF) calculation. \n",
    "Vibrational anharmonic correlations are added a-posteriori with perturbative or variational approaches.\n",
    "The latter include Vibrational Configuration Interaction (VCI) and Vibrational Coupled Cluster (VCC) for highly-accurate anharmonic energies. \n",
    "The main advantage of VCI and VCC over alternative approaches (such as perturnation theories) is that their accuracy can be systematically improved towards the complete basis set limit for a given PES. \n",
    "However, their applicability is limited to small molecules with up to about 10 atoms due to their unfavorable scaling with system size.\n",
    "\n",
    "To tackle the scaling problem we would like to use quantum algorithms.\n",

    "\n",
    "$\\mathcal{H}_\\text{vib}$ must be mapped to an operator that acts on the states of a given set of $N_q$ qubits in order to calculate its eigenfunctions on quantum hardware.\n",
    "In electronic structure calculations, the mapping is achieved by expressing the non-relativistic electronic Hamiltonian in second quantization, \\textit{i.e.} by projecting it onto the complete set of antisymmetrized occupation number vectors (ONV) generated by a given (finite) set of orbitals.\n",
    "To encode the vibrational Hamiltonian in an analogous second quantization operators, we expand the potential $V(Q_1, \\ldots, Q_L)$ with the $n$-body expansion as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "where $V_0$ is the electronic energy of the reference geometry, the one-mode term $V^{[l]}(Q_l)$ represents the variation of the PES upon change of the $l$-th normal coordinate from the equilibrium position.\n",
    "Similarly, the two-body potential $V^{[l,m]}(Q_l, Q_m)$ represents the change in the exact PES upon a simultaneous displacement along the $l$-th and $m$-th coordinates. \n",
    "Often, including terms up to three-body in the $L$-body expansion is sufficient to obtain an accuracy of about 1~cm$^{-1}$. We highlight that the many-body expansion of the potential operator defining the Watson Hamiltonian contains arbitrarly high coupling terms. This is a crucial difference compared to the non-relativistic electronic-structure Hamiltonian that contains only pairwise interactions.\n",
