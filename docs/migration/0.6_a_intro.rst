Qiskit Nature v0.6 Migration Guide
==================================

This document will guide you through the process of migrating your code from Qiskit Nature v0.5 to
v0.6

Overview
--------

Version 0.6 of Qiskit Nature comes with two major deprecations:

1. the ``(Minimum)EigensolverFactory`` utilities
2. the ``QubitConverter`` class


Both of these deprecations and explanations on how to update your code are provided in more detail
on the following pages:

- `(Minimum)EigensolverFactory migration guide`_
- `QubitConverter migration guide`_

Other notable deprecations
--------------------------

Here are a few other noteworthy minor changes which you should be aware of:

- The ``qiskit.opflow`` module is nearing its deprecation. This means that any usage of
  :class:`~qiskit.opflow.PauliSumOp` can now be replaced by its counterpart from the
  ``qiskit.quantum_info`` module, :class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.SparsePauliOp`. For more information,
  please refer to the `opflow migration guide`_.

- The :meth:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.problems.BaseProblem.symmetry_sector_locator` method is no
  longer needed in the new workflow around the :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.mappers.QubitMapper`
  classes. Instead, you should now use the new
  :meth:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.problems.BaseProblem.get_tapered_mapper` method. For more details,
  please refer to the `QubitConverter migration guide`_.

- The new :class:`.Tensor` class has been introduced which will become the default return type of
  objects stored in a :class:`.PolynomialTensor` instance. You can already switch to this by setting
  :attr:`~qiskit_nature.settings.tensor_unwrapping` to ``False``.
