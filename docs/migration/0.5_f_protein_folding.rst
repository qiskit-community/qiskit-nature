Protein Folding with Qiskit Nature v0.5
=======================================

The keen-eyed among you will have already noticed in the `overview of
the design of Qiskit Nature <./0.5_a_intro.ipynb>`__ that protein
folding was not mentioned at all. The reason for that is simply that it
does not align with the vision and goals of Qiskit Nature. Its status
was more of a prototype than a continuously developing feature like the
other parts of the package and on top of that it is really more a
chemistry-inspired *optimization problem* which is not something that is
currently in the scope of Qiskit Nature.

Thus, the entire code related to protein folding has been migrated to
the `Qiskit Research
repository <https://github.com/qiskit-research/qiskit-research>`__ from
where you can still install and use it, just like you have done so far,
except with the new import locations based on that package.

We suggest that you read `the updated
tutorial <https://qiskit-research.github.io/qiskit-research/protein_folding/protein_folding.html>`__
which should contain all information for you to migrate your code.
