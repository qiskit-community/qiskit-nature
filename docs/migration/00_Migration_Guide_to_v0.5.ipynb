    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us begin with an overview of the refactored design. A major motivator for the refactoring of Qiskit Nature was the goal of readying Qiskit Nature for more and tighter integrations with other classical-computational codes. In order to achieve this in the most modular and maintainable manner, we had to decouple the representation of our `BaseProblem` from our `BaseDriver` classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This led to the following abstract design of the Qiskit Nature package:\n",
    "![Qiskit Nature 0.5](aux_files/qiskit_nature_0.5_overview.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the package is logically divided into two concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **problems**: which are representations of scientific problems to which one seeks a solution\n",
    "2. **algorithms**: which provide the means to find solutions to said problems\n",
    "\n",
    "In each of these cases, Qiskit Nature has three pillars:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **problems**:\n",
    "    1. _Electronic Structure Problem_: representing the problem of the electronic Schrödinger equation of molecular systems\n",
    "    2. _Vibrational Structure Problem_: representing the problem posed by the Watson Hamiltonian of molecular systems\n",
    "    3. _Lattice Model Problem_: representing problems defined on lattices\n",
    "2. **algorithms**:\n",
    "    1. _Ground State Solver_: for finding the ground state of a problem\n",
    "    2. _Excited States Solver_: for finding excited states of a problem\n",
    "    3. _Hamiltonian Simulation_: to simulate dynamics of a problem (_planned for v0.6_)\n",
    "  \n",
    "Some of these concepts have already been present in earlier versions of Qiskit Nature, but were not as clearly separated. Furthermore, the integration with classical codes has been very restrictive in older versions, limiting not only the potential applications of such integrations, but also the capabilities of our `BaseProblem` representation, and its usage in the remainder of the package."

    "## How to use this guide\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide is split across multiple files allowing you to discover the changes between v0.4 and v0.5 to each submodule as you find the need. That means, you do not need to read all of the details at once and jumping around is highly encouraged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking the refactoring largely relocated any code from `qiskit_nature.X.second_quantization` to `qiskit_nature.second_q.X`. This should help you navigate the source code for most cases. However, in some specific cases we have re-categorized specific modules/classes, so be advised to look into the guides for more details below.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand what files you need to pay attention too, please carefully review the following list of topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Solving **any** problem](./00a_Solving_problems_with_v0.5.ipynb)\n",
    "- [Electronic Structure Problems](./00b_Electronic_structure_with_v0.5.ipynb)\n",
    "- [Vibrational Structure Problems](./00c_Vibrational_structure_with_v0.5.ipynb)\n",

    "\n",
    "- improved readability: in the example given below, it is immediately clear what a given argument does\n",
    "- improved forwards compatibility: adding more arguments in the future will be a lot simpler because keyword arguments are not order-dependent\n",
