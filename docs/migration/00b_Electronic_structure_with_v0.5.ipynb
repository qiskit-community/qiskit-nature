    "- The driver for [pyquante2](https://github.com/rpmuller/pyquante2) was removed, because its source code has not been updated for more than 3 years. Originally, it was supported to enable usage of Qiskit Nature on Windows, however, since then [psi4](https://github.com/psi4/psi4) has also added Windows support and the integration of the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux) has opened up further development possibilities.\n",
    "- The `HDF5Driver` was removed in favor of supporting the standardized [QCSchema](https://github.com/MolSSI/QCSchema) (see `qiskit_nature.second_q.formats.qcschema`).\n",
    "- The `ElectronicStructureMoleculeDriver` was removed because we are steering towards a future with tighter, plugin-like integration with classical codes, making the concept of drivers where Qiskit starts a classical simulation outdated. You can still use the `.from_molecule(...)` methods of the remaining drivers in combination with the `MoleculeInfo` class.\n",
    "- The `MoleculeInfo` has become a pure data container and no longer supports _degrees of freedom_.\n",
