    "# Solving Problems with v0.5\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "The major focus of the Qiskit Nature v0.5 refactoring was the description and representation of second-quantized operators and problems. Nonetheless, the `algorithms` module and supporting modules did also receive significant updates. Most importantly all algorithms In Nature are now dependent on the new Qiskit Terra algorithms, and these are now based on [Qiskit Primitives](https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/primitives.html) and were added in Qiskit Terra 0.22. It is not the intention to provide detailed explanations of the primitives in this migration guide. We suggest that you read the [corresponding resources](https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/primitives.html) of the Qiskit Terra documentation instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Table of Contents\n",

However, the entire module `qiskit_nature.mappers.second_quantization` has been moved to `qiskit_nature.second_q.mappers`. So updating your import is all you need to do here."

    "### Number of Orbitals\n",
    "\n",
    "We have been consistently describing the number of orbitals via `num_spin_orbitals` throughout the package. However, what this oftentimes implied (without rigorous checks) was that an **even** number was supplied, since the number of spin orbitals was assumed to equal twice the number of **spatial** orbitals.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be more rigorous and avoid the ill-defined behavior when providing _odd_ numbers for `num_spin_orbitals`, we have switched the entire stack to use `num_spatial_orbitals` instead. This is well defined for any positive integer value (and negative values are guarded against).\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means for you in practice, is that whenever you supply the `num_spin_orbitals` manually in the past, you now need to supply **half the value** to represent the `num_spatial_orbitals`."
