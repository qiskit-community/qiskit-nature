Overview
==============

**Qiskit Nature** is an open-source framework which supports solving quantum mechanical natural
science problems using quantum computing algorithms. This includes finding ground and excited
states of electronic and vibrational structure problems, measuring the dipole moments of molecular
systems, solving the Ising and Fermi-Hubbard models on lattices, and much more.

The code comprises various modules revolving around:

- data loading from chemistry drivers or file formats
- second-quantized operator construction and manipulation
- translating from the second-quantized to the qubit space
- a quantum circuit library of natural science targeted ansatze
- natural science specific algorithms and utilities to make the use of
  algorithms from `Qiskit Algorithms <https://qiskit-community.github.io/qiskit-algorithms/>`_ easier
- and much more
