class MixedOp(LinearMixin):
    """Mixed operator.

    A ``MixedOp`` represents a weighted sum of products of operators such as fermionic, bosonic or spin
    operators acting on respective Hilbert spaces. The terms to be summed are encoded in a dictionary,
    where each operator product is identified by its key, a tuple of string specifying the names of the
    local Hilbert spaces on which it acts, and by its value, a list of tuple (corresponding to a sum of
    operators acting on the same composite Hilbert space) where each tuple encodes the coupling
    coefficient and the operators themselves (that might also have coefficients associated with them).


    **Initialization**

    A ``MixedOp`` is initialized with a dictionary, mapping terms to their respective
    coefficients:

    .. code-block:: python

        from qiskit_nature.second_q.operators import FermionicOp, SpinOp, MixedOp

        fop1 = FermionicOp({"+_0 -_0": 1}) # Acting on Hilbert space "h1"
        sop1 = SpinOp({"X_0 Y_0": 1}, num_spins=1) # Acting on Hilbert space "s1"

        mop1 = MixedOp({("h1",): [(5.0, fop1)]})
        mop2 = MixedOp(
            {
                ("h1", "s1"): [(3, fop1, sop1)],
                ("s1",): [(2, sop1)],
            }
        )
        # 5.0 * fop1 (acts as identity on the spin Hilbert space)
        # 3*(fop1 @ sop1) (fermion-spin coupling term)
        # 2*(sop1) (acts as identity on the fermionic Hilbert space)


    **Algebra**

    This class supports the following basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, scalar
    multiplication, operator multiplication.
    For example,

    Addition

    .. code-block:: python

        fop1 = FermionicOp({"+_0 -_0": 1}) # Acting on Hilbert space "h1"
        sop1 = SpinOp({"X_0 Y_0": 1}, num_spins=1) # Acting on Hilbert space "s1"
        MixedOp({("h1",): [(5.0, fop1)]}) + MixedOp({("s1",): [(6.0, sop1)]})
        # MixedOp({("h1",): [(5.0, fop1)], ("s1",): [(6.0, sop1)]})

    Scalar multiplication

    .. code-block:: python

        fop1 = FermionicOp({"+_0 -_0": 1})
        0.5 * MixedOp({("h1",): [(5.0, fop1)]})

    Operator multiplication

    .. code-block:: python

        fop1 = FermionicOp({"+_0 -_0": 1}) # Acting on Hilbert space "h1"
        sop1 = SpinOp({"X_0 Y_0": 1}, num_spins=1) # Acting on Hilbert space "s1"
        MixedOp({("h1",): [(5.0, fop1)]}) @ MixedOp({("s1",): [(6.0, sop1)]})
        # MixedOp({("h1", "s1"): [(30.0, fop1, sop1)]})
