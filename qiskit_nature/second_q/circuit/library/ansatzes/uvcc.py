    This trial wavefunction is a Unitary Vibrational Coupled-Cluster ansatz.

    This method constructs the requested excitations based on a
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.circuit.library.VSCF` reference state by default. When setting
    up a ``VQE`` algorithm using this ansatz and initial state, it is likely you will also want to
    use a :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.algorithms.initial_points.VSCFInitialPoint` that has been
    configured using the corresponding ansatz parameters. When using a
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.algorithms.VQEUVCCFactory` this is set by default. When directly
    using ``VQE``, you can set it manually. For example:

    .. code-block:: python

        qubit_converter = QubitConverter(JordanWignerMapper())
        uvcc = UVCC([2, 2], 'sd', qubit_converter)
        vscf_initial_point = VSCFInitialPoint()
        vscf_initial_point.ansatz = uvcc
        initial_point = vscf_initial_point.to_numpy_array()
        vqe = VQE(Estimator(), uvcc, SLSQP(), initial_point=initial_point)

            excitations: This can be any of the following types:

                    singles, ``'d'`` for doubles, ``'t'`` for triples, and ``'q'`` for quadruples.
                :`int`: A single, positive integer which denotes the number of excitations
                    (``1 == 's'``, ``2 == 'd'``, etc.).
                :`list[int]`: A list of positive integers generalizing the above to multiple numbers
                    of excitations (``[1, 2] == 'sd'``, etc.).
                :`Callable`: A function which is used to generate the excitations.
                    The callable must take the *keyword* argument ``num_modals``
                    (with identical type to that explained above) and must return a

                which takes care of mapping to a qubit operator.
            reps: The number of repetitions of basic module.
            initial_state: A ``QuantumCircuit`` object to prepend to the circuit. Note that this
                setting does *not* influence the ``excitations``. When relying on the default
                generation method (i.e. not providing a ``Callable`` to ``excitations``), these will
