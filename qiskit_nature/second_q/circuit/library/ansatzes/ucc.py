class UCC(EvolvedOperatorAnsatz):
    r"""The Unitary Coupled-Cluster Ansatz. For more information, see [1].

    This ansatz is an ``EvolvedOperatorAnsatz`` given by :math:`e^{T - T^{\dagger}}` where
    :math:`T` is the *cluster operator*. This cluster operator generally consists of excitation
    operators which are generated by
    :meth:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.circuit.library.ansatzes.utils.generate_fermionic_excitations`.

    This method constructs the requested excitations based on a
    :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.circuit.library.HartreeFock` reference state by default. When
    setting up a ``VQE`` algorithm using this ansatz and initial state, it is likely you will also
    want to use a :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.algorithms.initial_points.HFInitialPoint` that has
    been configured using the corresponding ansatz parameters. This can be done as follows:

    .. code-block:: python

        qubit_mapper = JordanWignerMapper()
        ucc = UCC(4, (2, 2), 'sd', qubit_mapper)
        hf_initial_point = HFInitialPoint()
        hf_initial_point.ansatz = ucc
        initial_point = hf_initial_point.to_numpy_array()
        vqe = VQE(Estimator(), ucc, SLSQP(), initial_point=initial_point)

    You can also use a custom excitation generator method by passing a callable to ``excitations``.

    A utility class :class:`UCCSD` exists, which is equivalent to:

    .. code-block:: python

        uccsd = UCC(excitations='sd', alpha_spin=True, beta_spin=True, max_spin_excitation=None)

    If you want to use a tailored ansatz, you have multiple options to do so. Below, we provide some
    examples:

    .. code-block:: python

        # pure single excitations (equivalent options):
        uccs = UCC(excitations='s')
        uccs = UCC(excitations=1)
        uccs = UCC(excitations=[1])

        # pure double excitations (equivalent options):
        uccd = UCC(excitations='d')
        uccd = UCC(excitations=2)
        uccd = UCC(excitations=[2])

        # combinations of excitations:
        custom_ucc_sd = UCC(excitations='sd')  # see also the convenience sub-class UCCSD
        custom_ucc_sd = UCC(excitations=[1, 2])  # see also the convenience sub-class UCCSD
        custom_ucc_sdt = UCC(excitations='sdt')
        custom_ucc_sdt = UCC(excitations=[1, 2, 3])
        custom_ucc_st = UCC(excitations='st')
        custom_ucc_st = UCC(excitations=[1, 3])

        # you can even define a fully custom list of excitations:

        def custom_excitation_list(num_spatial_orbitals: int,
                                   num_particles: tuple[int, int]
                                   ) -> list[tuple[tuple[Any, ...], ...]]:
            # generate your list of excitations...
            my_excitation_list = [...]
            # For more information about the required format of the return statement, please take a
            # look at the documentation of
            # `qiskit_nature.second_q.circuit.library.ansatzes.utils.fermionic_excitation_generator`
            return my_excitation_list

        my_custom_ucc = UCC(excitations=custom_excitation_list)

    Keep in mind, that in all of the examples above we have not set any of the following keyword
    arguments, which must be specified before the ansatz becomes usable:

    - ``qubit_mapper``
    - ``num_particles``
    - ``num_spatial_orbitals``

    If you are using this ansatz with a Qiskit Nature algorithm, these arguments will be set for
    you, depending on the rest of the stack.

        Args:
            num_spatial_orbitals: The number of spatial orbitals.
            num_particles: The tuple of the number of alpha- and beta-spin particles.
            excitations: This can be any of the following types:

                :`str`: Contains the types of excitations. Allowed characters are: ``'s'`` for
                    singles, ``'d'`` for doubles, ``'t'`` for triples, and ``'q'`` for quadruples.
                :`int`: A single, positive integer which denotes the number of excitations
                    (``1 == 's'``, ``2 == 'd'``, etc.)
                :`list[int]`: A list of positive integers generalizing the above to multiple numbers
                    of excitations (``[1, 2] == 'sd'``, etc.)
                :`Callable`: A function which is used to generate the excitations.
                    The callable must take the *keyword* arguments ``num_spatial_orbitals`` and
                    ``num_particles`` (with identical types to those explained above) and must return
                    a ``list[tuple[tuple[int, ...], tuple[int, ...]]]``. For more information on how
                    to write such a callable refer to the default method
                    :meth:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.circuit.library.ansatzes.utils.\
                    generate_fermionic_excitations`.
            qubit_mapper: The :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.mappers.QubitMapper` which takes care
                of mapping to a qubit operator.
            alpha_spin: Boolean flag whether to include alpha-spin excitations.
            beta_spin: Boolean flag whether to include beta-spin excitations.
            max_spin_excitation: The largest number of excitations within a spin. E.g. you can set
                this to 1 and ``num_excitations`` to 2 in order to obtain only mixed-spin double
                excitations (alpha,beta) but no pure-spin double excitations (alpha,alpha or
                beta,beta).
            generalized: Boolean flag whether or not to use generalized excitations, which ignore
                the occupation of the spin orbitals. As such, the set of generalized excitations is
                only determined from the number of spin orbitals and independent from the number of
                particles.
            preserve_spin: Boolean flag whether or not to preserve the particle spins.
            include_imaginary: Boolean flag which when set to ``True`` expands the ansatz to include
                imaginary parts using twice the number of free parameters.
            reps: The number of times to repeat the evolved operators.
            initial_state: A ``QuantumCircuit`` object to prepend to the circuit. Note that this
                setting does *not* influence the ``excitations``. When relying on the default
                generation method (i.e. not providing a ``Callable`` to ``excitations``), these will
                always be constructed with respect to a
                :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.circuit.library.HartreeFock` reference state.
                When setting up a ``VQE`` algorithm using this ansatz and initial state, it is
                likely you will also want to use a
                :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.algorithms.initial_points.HFInitialPoint` that has
                been configured using the corresponding ansatz parameters.
