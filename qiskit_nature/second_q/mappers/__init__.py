Mappers (:mod:`qiskit_nature.second_q.mappers`)
===============================================

.. currentmodule:: qiskit_nature.second_q.mappers

The classes here are used to convert fermionic, vibrational and spin operators to qubit operators.

   QubitMapper

   BravyiKitaevSuperFastMapper
   JordanWignerMapper
   ParityMapper

**Interleaved Qubit-Ordering:** If you want to generate qubit operators where the alpha-spin and
beta-spin components are mapped to the qubit register in an interleaved (rather than the default
blocked) order, you can use the following wrapper:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../stubs/
   :nosignatures:

   InterleavedQubitMapper

VibrationalOp Mappers
+++++++++++++++++++++

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../stubs/
   :nosignatures:

   DirectMapper


SpinOp Mappers

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../stubs/
   :nosignatures:

   LinearMapper
   LogarithmicMapper

Tapered Qubit Mapper
++++++++++++++++++++

If you want to make use of the symmetries of your problem and add a step of tapering
after the mapping to qubit operators, you can use the following wrapper for symmetry reduction:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../stubs/
   :nosignatures:

   TaperedQubitMapper

Qubit Converter
+++++++++++++++

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../stubs/
   :nosignatures:

   QubitConverter
