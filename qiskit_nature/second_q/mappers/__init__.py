Mappers (:mod:`qiskit_nature.second_q.mappers`)
===============================================

.. currentmodule:: qiskit_nature.second_q.mappers

The classes here are used to convert fermionic, bosonic, vibrational and spin operators to qubit
operators.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../stubs/
   :nosignatures:

   QubitMapper
   ModeBasedMapper

FermionicOp Mappers
+++++++++++++++++++

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../stubs/
   :nosignatures:

   BravyiKitaevMapper
   BravyiKitaevSuperFastMapper
   JordanWignerMapper
   ParityMapper
   TernaryTreeMapper

**Note:** :class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.mappers.TernaryTreeMapper` maps
:class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.operators.MajoranaOp` to
:class:`~qiskit.quantum_info.SparsePauliOp`. In order to use it on a
:class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.operators.FermionicOp`, convert to a
:class:`~qiskit_nature.second_q.operators.MajoranaOp` first using
:code:`MajoranaOp.from_fermionic_op()`.

**Interleaved Qubit-Ordering:** If you want to generate qubit operators where the alpha-spin and
beta-spin components are mapped to the qubit register in an interleaved (rather than the default
blocked) order, you can use the following wrapper:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../stubs/
   :nosignatures:

   InterleavedQubitMapper


BosonicOp Mappers
+++++++++++++++++++

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../stubs/
   :nosignatures:

   BosonicLinearMapper
   BosonicLogarithmicMapper

VibrationalOp Mappers
+++++++++++++++++++++

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../stubs/
   :nosignatures:

   DirectMapper


SpinOp Mappers
++++++++++++++

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../stubs/
   :nosignatures:

   LinearMapper
   LogarithmicMapper

Tapered Qubit Mapper
++++++++++++++++++++

If you want to make use of the symmetries of your problem and add a step of tapering
after the mapping to qubit operators, you can use the following wrapper for symmetry reduction:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../stubs/
   :nosignatures:

   TaperedQubitMapper

MixedOp Mappers
+++++++++++++++

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../stubs/
   :nosignatures:

   MixedMapper
