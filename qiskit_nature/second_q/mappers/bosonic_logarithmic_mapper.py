class BosonicLogarithmicMapper(BosonicMapper):
    """The Logarithmic boson-to-qubit Mapper.

    This mapper generates a logarithmic encoding of the Bosonic operator :math:`b_k^\\dagger, b_k` to
    qubit operators (linear combinations of pauli strings).
    In this logarithmic encoding the number of qubits necessary to represent a bosonic mode is
    determined by the max occupation :math:`n_k^{max}` of the mode (meaning the number of states used
    in the expansion of the mode, or equivalently the state at which the maximum excitation can take
    place). The number of qubits is given by:
    :math:`\\lceil\\log_2(n_k^{max} + 1)\\rceil`.

    .. note::
        A consequence of the rounding up for determining the number of required qubits is that the
        actual max occupation is often larger than the one selected by the user. For example, if the
        user selects :math:`n_k^{max} = 2`, then the number of required qubits is
        :math:`\\lceil\\log_2(3)\\rceil = 2`. If we now compute the max occupation for 2 qubits, we
        get :math:`2^2 - 1 = 3`, which is larger than the user-selected max occupation. The user should
        expect that the actual max occupation is always larger than or equal to the one selected.
        If the code changes the max occupation, a warning will appear in the logs.

    The mode :math:`|k\\rangle` is then mapped to the occupation number vector
    :math:`|0_{n_k^{max}}, 0_{n_k^{max} - 1},..., 0_{n_k + 1}, 1_{n_k}, 0_{n_k - 1},..., 0_{0_k}\\rangle`

    This class implements the equation (34) and (35) of Reference [1].

    .. math::
        b_k^\\dagger = \\sum_{n_k = 0}^{2^{N_q}-2}\\left(\\sqrt{n_k + 1}|n+1\\rangle\\langle n|\\right)

        b_k = \\sum_{n_k = 1}^{2^{N_q}-1}\\left(\\sqrt{n_k}|n-1\\rangle\\langle n|\\right)

    where :math:`N_q` is the number of qubits used to represent each mode
    (given by :math:`\\lceil\\log_2(n_k^{max} + 1)\\rceil`). This implementation first computes each
    :math:`|n+1\\rangle\\langle n|` and :math:`|n-1\\rangle\\langle n|` in a binary representation
    and then uses equation (37) from Reference [1] to map to the Pauli operators.

    The length of the qubit register is:

    .. code-block:: python

        BosonicOp.num_modes * math.ceil(numpy.log2(BosonicLogarithmicMapper.max_occupation + 1))

    Below is an example of how one can use this mapper:

    .. code-block:: python

        from qiskit_nature.second_q.mappers import BosonicLogarithmicMapper
        from qiskit_nature.second_q.operators import BosonicOp

        mapper = BosonicLogarithmicMapper(max_occupation=2)
        qubit_op = mapper.map(BosonicOp({'+_0 -_0': 1}, num_modes=1))

    .. note::
        Since this mapper truncates the maximum occupation of a bosonic state as represented in the
        qubit register, the commutation relations after the mapping differ from the standard ones.
        Please refer to Section 4, equation 22 of Reference [2] for more details.
