Protein Folding Problems (:mod:`qiskit_nature.problems.sampling.protein_folding`)
=================================================================================
The protein to be folded is defined in a Peptide class. Each peptide consists of one and only one
main chain and optionally several side chains. Side chains cannot be attached to the first or
last main bead. First and last main beads with a side chain can be modeled by
elongating the main chain with corresponding side chains. No side chain attached to a second main
bead allows for saving 1 qubit in the qubit encoding of a main chain without loss of generality
due to symmetry arguments (see the paper cited below).

Each chain consists of beads that encode information about the turn that follows to another main
bead (in case of main beads) or into a side bead (in case of side beads). Moreover, each bead is
characterized by a letter which encodes its residue sequence and defines the energy of
interactions with other beads (unless interactions are random).

Currently, only interactions involving first nearest neighbors are supported. Each side chain is
attached to one and only one main bead.

At the moment, only side chains of length 1 (i.e. with 1 bead) are supported which is a
simplifying assumption. A generalization of this approach is for future investigation.

Constraints on feasible folds are incorporated in the objective function using penalty terms
whose importance is regulated by parameters in the PenaltyParameters class.

In the final operator for the problem qubit registers have the following meaning:
(interactions qubits) tensored with (conformation qubits),
which can be further broken down into the following groups:
(main-main beads interactions) tensored with (side-side beads interactions) tensored with
(main-side beads interactions) tensored with (side-main beads interactions) tensored with
(side conformation qubits) tensored with (main conformation qubits).
We build interaction operators according to the following indexing:
lower_bead_position * chain_len + upper_bead_position,
i.e. the position of a block encodes the index of a lower bead and the position in a block
encodes the index of an upper bead.
All qubits are indexed from right to left.
