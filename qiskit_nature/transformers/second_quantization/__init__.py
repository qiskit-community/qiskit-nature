QMolecule Transformers (:mod:`qiskit_nature.transformers.second_quantization`)
==============================================================================

.. currentmodule:: qiskit_nature.transformers.second_quantization

Transformers act on a :class:`~qiskit_nature.drivers.QMolecule` to produce an altered copy of it as
per the specific transformer. So for instance the :class:`FreezeCoreTransformer` will alter the
integrals and number of particles in a way that freezes the core orbitals, storing an extracted
energy in the QMolecule to compensate for this that would need to be included back into any ground
state energy computation to get complete result.
