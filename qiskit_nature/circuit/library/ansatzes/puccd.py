    """The PUCCD Ansatz.

    The PUCCD Ansatz (by default) only contains double excitations. Furthermore, it enforces all
    excitations to occur in parallel in the alpha and beta species. For more information see also
    [1].

    Note, that this Ansatz can only work for singlet-spin systems. Therefore, the number of alpha
    and beta electrons must be equal.

    This is a convenience subclass of the UCC Ansatz. For more information refer to :class:`UCC`.
