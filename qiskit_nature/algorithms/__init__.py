.. currentmodule:: qiskit_nature.algorithms

These are natural science algorithms to solve specific problems such as finding the ground state
energy, excited state energies or potential energy surfaces.

Excited State Solvers
+++++++++++++++++++++
Algorithms that can find the eigenvalues of an operator, e.g. excited states for chemistry.

The interface for such solvers,

   :toctree: ../stubs/
   :nosignatures:

   ExcitedStatesSolver

the solvers themselves

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../stubs/
   :nosignatures:

   ExcitedStatesEigensolver
   QEOM

and factories to provision Quantum and/or Classical algorithms upon which the above solvers may
depend

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../stubs/
   :nosignatures:

   EigensolverFactory
   NumPyEigensolverFactory

Ground State Solvers
++++++++++++++++++++
Algorithms that can find the minimum eigenvalue of an operator, e.g. ground state for chemistry.

The interface for such solvers,

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../stubs/
   :nosignatures:

   GroundStateSolver

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../stubs/
   :nosignatures:

   AdaptVQE
   GroundStateEigensolver

and factories to provision Quantum and/or Classical algorithms upon which the above solvers may
depend

Potential Energy Surface Samplers
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Algorithms that can compute potential energy surfaces.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../stubs/
   :nosignatures:

   ~pes_samplers.BOPESSampler

The samplers include extrapolators to facilitate convergence across a set of points and support
of various potentials. More detail may be found in the sub-module linked below
