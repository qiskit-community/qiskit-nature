PyQuante Installation
=====================
`PyQuante <https://github.com/rpmuller/pyquante2/>`__ is an open-source library for computational
chemistry. Qiskit's chemistry module specifically requires PyQuante V2, also known as PyQuante2.
In order for Qiskit to interface PyQuante and execute
PyQuante to extract the electronic structure information PyQuante2 must be installed and
discoverable on the system where the Qiskit chemistry module is also installed.

Installing PyQuante2 according to the
`installation instructions <https://github.com/rpmuller/pyquante2/blob/master/README.md>`__ while
in the Python virtual environment where Qiskit's chemistry module has also been installed will
automatically make PyQuante2 dynamically discovered by Qiskit at run time. If you are not using
conda then alternatively you can git clone or download/unzip a zip of the repository and run pip
install off the setup.py that is there.

.. note::
    Like all the other drivers currently interfaced by the chemistry module,
    PyQuante2 provides enough intermediate data for Qiskit to compute a molecule's ground
    state molecular energy.  However, unlike the other drivers, the data computed by PyQuante is
    not sufficient for Qiskit to compute a molecule's dipole moment.  Therefore, PyQuante
    is currently the only driver interfaced by Qiskit's chemistry module that does not allow for the
    computation of a molecule's dipole moment.
