    A Property in Qiskit Nature provides the means to give meaning to a given set of raw data.

    `qiskit_nature.drivers.BaseDriver`) into a
    `qiskit_nature.operators.second_quantization.SecondQuantizedOp`.
    As such, every Property is an object which constructs an operator to be evaluated during the
    problem solution and the interface provides the means for a user to write any custom Property
    (i.e. the user can evaluate custom _observables_ by writing a class which can generate an
    operator out of a given set of raw data).
