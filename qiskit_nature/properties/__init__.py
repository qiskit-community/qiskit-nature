.. currentmodule:: qiskit_nature.properties


Qiskit Nature ships with a library of commonly evaluates ``Property`` objects (or _observables_).
These objects provide the means to map from raw data (as produced by e.g. a
``qiskit_nature.drivers.BaseDriver``) to an operator which can be evaluated during the Quantum
algorithm.
This provides a powerful interface through which a user will be able to insert custom objects which
they desire to evaluate.
