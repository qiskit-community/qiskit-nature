Electronic Structure Properties (:mod:`qiskit_nature.properties.second_quantization.electronic`)
================================================================================================

.. currentmodule:: qiskit_nature.properties.second_quantization.electronic

This module provides commonly evaluated properties for *electronic* problems.

The main ``Property`` of this module is the

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../stubs/
   :nosignatures:

   ElectronicEnergy

which constructs the primary Hamiltonian whose solution is the goal of the Quantum Algorithm.
The following auxiliary properties will be evaluated by default to provide further details of the
solution:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../stubs/
   :nosignatures:

   ParticleNumber
   AngularMomentum
   Magnetization

With these properties you can measure the number of particles, spin, etc. of your system during your
simulation. This allows you to perform checks of your solution with regards to (e.g.) particle
conservation. This is especially important when using an Ansatz which is not particle-conserving by
itself.

Finally, if the driver which you used provided dipole moment integrals, this property will also be
evaluated:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: ../stubs/
   :nosignatures:

   TotalDipoleMoment
